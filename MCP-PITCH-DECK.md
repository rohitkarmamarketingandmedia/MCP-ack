## SLIDE 2: The Problem

**Content marketing is broken for local businesses.**

- Quality SEO content costs $300-500 per article
- Takes 2-4 weeks to research, write, optimize
- Most agencies lose money on content-heavy retainers
- Clients churn because results take 6-12 months

**Visual:** Calculator showing traditional costs vs. revenue = negative margin

| **Total Cost** | **$3,500** |
| Client pays | $2,500 |

# Presenter Notes

## Key Talking Points:

1. **Lead with the pain** - Agencies know content is expensive and slow
2. **Show the math** - Numbers are undeniable
3. **Demo live** - Generate content during the pitch
4. **Focus on margins** - 95% vs. negative margins
5. **Address AI quality concerns** - Show actual output, explain SEO structure
6. **Create urgency** - "While you're manually writing, competitors are scaling"

## Objection Handling:

**"AI content doesn't rank"**
→ Show case studies. Explain SEO structure enforcement. Offer pilot.

**"My clients want human-written content"**
→ "They want content that ranks. This does. And you can edit anything."

**"What about duplicate content?"**
→ Each generation is unique. Per-client customization. Plagiarism checks available.

**"We already use ChatGPT"**
→ "ChatGPT is a tool. This is a system. Intake, research, generation, publishing, monitoring—all integrated."

## Demo Script:

1. Open Agency Dashboard (30 sec) - "Here's your command center"
2. Show Intake Form (30 sec) - "Client fills this out or you paste a transcript"
3. Click Generate (live, 2 min) - "Watch this..."
4. Show Output (1 min) - "10 blog posts, 30 social posts, all SEO-optimized"
5. Show AI Agents (30 sec) - "You can customize everything here"
6. Show Client Portal (30 sec) - "This is what your client sees"

**Total demo time: 5 minutes**
