# MCP Framework™
## AI-Powered Marketing Automation Platform

---

### The Problem

Local businesses need consistent, SEO-optimized content to rank on Google. But quality content is expensive ($500+ per blog post), slow (weeks to produce), and most agencies can't scale it profitably.

**The math doesn't work:**
- 4 blog posts/month × $500 = $2,000 in content costs alone
- Add strategy, research, publishing = $3,500+ 
- Client pays $2,500/month = **you lose money**

---

### The Solution

**MCP Framework** is a proprietary AI marketing engine that generates months of SEO-optimized content in minutes—not weeks.

One client intake. One click. Complete marketing package.
